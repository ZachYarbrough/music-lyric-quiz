Introduction 

A fun game to play with friends and family where you get presented lyrics and have to guess the genre of the song the lyrics go to.  You get 15 seconds to guess the genre.  If you guess the genre correctly you advance to the next lyrics, but if you get it wrong you lose 5 seconds.  You get 10 points for every correct lyric you get correct, and go up to 100.  At the end of the game you will receive a score, and based on that score you will be presented a certain GIF.
